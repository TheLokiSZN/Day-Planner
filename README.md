# Day-Planner

## For this assignment I was tasked with making a day planner that accurately updates the schedule by showing the current time by color indication.
### The planner works as follows:
1. The planner is updated to the current date and time of day accurately.
2. the planner changes colors. Red = current time. Green = future time and, Gray = past time.
3. You are able to type anything within that timeslot and be able to save that text to your pc's local storage.
4. A notification pops up when successfully saved.
5. Text stays in time paramaters when refreshing the page.
## This planner is good for every day of the year and will save all your appointments and plans. Never lose track of your daily schedule again!
